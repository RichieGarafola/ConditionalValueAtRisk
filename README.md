CVaR captures more information than VaRÂ¶ CVaR is an improvement over VaR and is considered superior by practitioners. It takes into consideration the actual shape of the distribution and quantifies the tail risk. CVaR is also known as the expected shortfall since it measures the expectation of all the different possible losses greater than VaR.
